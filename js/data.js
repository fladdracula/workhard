  "<p>As you are no doubt very aware, the new machine-learning economy has significantly reduced the demand for human-produced labour, leading to unemployment rates of over 95%.</p>" +
  "<p>Although many humans find themselves able to adapt to this post-work era some among you struggle with a sense of ineffectiveness and a lack of productivity. We take this very seriously.</p>" +
  "<p><i>It is as if you were doing work</i> is an application created especially for those humans who feel a need to recapture an appearance of usefulness through traditional human-computer interaction.</p>" +
  "<p>Please feel free to launch <i>It is as if you were doing work</i> whenever existential concerns about contributing to a larger framework of industry assail you. Consider organising with groups of friends to 'work' with <i>It is as if you were doing work</i> in a larger office setting.</p>" +
  "<p>And remember: you are human, you are important.<p>";

  "Never stop fighting until you arrive at your destined place - that is, the unique you. Have an aim in life, continuously acquire knowledge, work hard, and have perseverance to realise the great life.",
  // "A birthday is just another day where you go to work and people give you love. Age is just a state of mind, and you are as old as you think you are. You have to count your blessings and be happy.",
  "Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come.",
  "The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.",
  // "To be a champion, I think you have to see the big picture. It's not about winning and losing; it's about every day hard work and about thriving on a challenge. It's about embracing the pain that you'll experience at the end of a race and not being afraid. I think people think too hard and get afraid of a certain challenge.",

  "Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did.",

  // "Feelings aroused by the touch of someone's hand, the sound of music, the smell of a flower, a beautiful sunset, a work of art, love, laughter, hope and faith - all work on both the unconscious and the conscious aspects of the self, and they have physiological consequences as well.",
  // "Youth is the gift of nature, but age is a work of art.",

  "There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.",
  // "Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people.",
  // "I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death.",
  // "Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.",
  "Happiness does not come from doing easy work but from the afterglow of satisfaction that comes after the achievement of a difficult task that demanded our best.",
  // "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.",
  // "A satisfied customer is the best business strategy of all.",
  // "If people like you, they'll listen to you, but if they trust you, they'll do business with you.",
  // "My philosophy is it's none of my business what people say of me and think of me. I am what I am, and I do what I do. I expect nothing and accept everything. And it makes life so much easier.",
  // "Before you can become a millionaire, you must learn to think like one. You must learn how to motivate yourself to counter fear with courage. Making critical decisions about your career, business, investments and other resources conjures up fear, fear that is part of the process of becoming a financial success.",
  "Ideas pull the trigger, but instinct loads the gun.",

  "Details create the big picture.",
  // "In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.",
  // "Information technology and business are becoming inextricably interwoven. I don't think anybody can talk meaningfully about one without the talking about the other.",
  // "A brand for a company is like a reputation for a person. You earn reputation by trying to do hard things well.",
  // "A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.",
  // "There is only one boss. The customer. And he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else.",

  "There is always space for improvement, no matter how long you've been in the business.",
  // "There's nobody in the business strong enough to scare me.",
  // "Do what you love to do and give it your very best. Whether it's business or baseball, or the theater, or any field. If you don't love what you're doing and you can't give it your best, get out of it. Life is too short. You'll be an old man before you know it.",
  // "Sales are contingent upon the attitude of the salesman - not the attitude of the prospect.",
  // "Commitment, belief and positive attitude are all important if you're going to be a success, whether you're in sports, in business or, as in my case, anthropology.",
  // "Business has only two functions - marketing and innovation."
